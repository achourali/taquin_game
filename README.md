# Taquin game

The goal is to solve the taquin with different algorithms:

* A star
* bfs (breadth first search)
* dfs (depth first search)
* interactive solving (you can solve it yourself interactively)

After the program solves the taquin you will get a visual graph of all opened and closed nodes and the solution path colored in pdf file inside ./solution_graphs
